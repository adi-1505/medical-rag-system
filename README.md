- **Relevance scoring** - Ranks results by content similarity
- **Multi-topic search** - Searches across all medical domains
- **Context-aware responses** - Combines multiple sources for comprehensive answers

## üìÅ File Structure

```
medical-rag-offline/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app-simple.py          # Main Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # This documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                  # Additional resources (if any)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing the Knowledge Base
The medical knowledge is stored in the `MEDICAL_KNOWLEDGE` dictionary within `app-simple.py`. To add new medical topics:

1. **Add new topic structure**:
```python
MEDICAL_KNOWLEDGE["new_topic"] = {
    "subtopic1": "Medical information content...",
    "subtopic2": "More medical information...",
}
```

2. **Update search keywords** in the `search_medical_knowledge` function
3. **Test with relevant queries**

### Interface Customization
- **Colors and styling** - Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown()` sections
- **Sample queries** - Update the `sample_queries` list
- **Medical disclaimers** - Customize disclaimer text as needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

```
streamlit>=1.28.0
